This initiative roller was made by badooga. https://github.com/badooga/Python-Files

You can use this nifty program to quickly and easily roll
initiative for both your players and your enemy combatants.
The intention was to make this program as simple and easy
to use as possible while still being customizable. Even if
your players would rather roll initiative themselves, you
can use this program to roll for your enemies, NPCs, and
miscellaneous factions and groups. Have fun DMing!
