This assistant program was made by badooga. https://github.com/badooga/Python-Files

The intended use of this program is that you open it whenever you turn on your computer for the sake of viewing reminders and such.

If you want to use the Task Scheduler to automate this, put assistant.bat in the same folder as
assistant.exe and use Task Scheduler to open assistant.bat on login.

I hope you like this program!

Tip: The function that opens playlists and the function that opens songs both use
startswith() method. What this means is that if you want to open a song or playlist
with a name of "example", you can simply type "e" and it will open that song or playlist.
However, if you have a file with a name of "entrance" in the same folder, only typing "e"
might open that instead. So, I suggest numbering your file names, so you would be
able to type "1." or "2." to open the intended song or playlist.
