# Programs
Welcome! In this repository you will find some small, noobish programs and files to make the lives of me and you a little bit easier.
You are free to use these files however you want to (in fact, that's highly encouraged), given that credit is clearly given to me for what you use.
Also, if you have any contributions to make (whether it's an edit or a brand new file), please feel free to make a pull request for it.
