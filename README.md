# Programs
Welcome! In this repository you will find some small programs and files to make the lives of me and you a little bit easier. Some of them are D&D themed, some of them are obscure coding QoL files, and some others are probably useless to you.
You are free to use these files however you'd like (in fact, that's highly encouraged), given that credit is clearly given.
Also, if you have any contributions to make (whether it's an edit or a brand new file), please feel free to make a pull request.
